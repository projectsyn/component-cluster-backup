= Cluster Backup

Cluster Backup is a Commodore component to manage backups of a Kubernetes cluster.
It builds on top of https://github.com/vshn/k8up[k8up].
Backups are created for snapshots of etcd and for json dumps of individual objects.

NOTE: Currently, etcd backups are only supported on OpenShift 4.

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.
