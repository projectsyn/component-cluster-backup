= Parameters

The parent key for all of the following parameters is `cluster_backup`.


== `enabled`

[horizontal]
type:: bool
default:: `true`

Whether to create the ArgoCD app for the component.
Setting this to false, effectively disables the component from being deployed.

NOTE: The manifests will still appear in the catalog, but without the ArgoCD app they won't get deployed.

== `namespace`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `syn-cluster-backup`

The namespace in which to deploy this component.

== `backend_type`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `s3`
values:: `s3`, `sftp`

Which backend type to configure for the backup.
Currently, the component supports backing up to S3 (compatible) buckets and SFTP.

== `bucket`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary

Holds the name and credentials for an S3 type storage bucket.
This bucket will be used to store the backups.

TIP: The bucket configuration is ignored (but must be present) when `backend_type` isn't set to `s3`.

=== `accesskey`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `'?{vaultkv:${cluster:tenant}/${cluster:name}/cluster-backup/s3_access_key}'`

The access key needed to access the storage bucket.
The default is a reference to a secret within Vault.

=== `name`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `${cluster:name}-cluster-backup`

The name of the storage bucket.

=== `secretkey`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `'?{vaultkv:${cluster:tenant}/${cluster:name}/cluster-backup/s3_secret_key}'`

The secret key needed to access the storage bucket.
The default is a reference to a secret within Vault.

== `sftp`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary

This section holds SFTP connection details.
When `backend_type` is set to `sftp`, the SFTP connection will be used to store the backups.

TIP: The SFTP configuration is ignored when `backend_type` isn't set to `sftp`.

=== `host`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `sftp.example.com`

The host name of the SFTP server.
Must resolve on the cluster.

== `port`

[horizontal]
type:: number
default:: `22`

The port on which the SFTP server listens for incoming SSH connections.

== `user`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `exampleuser`

The user name to use when connecting to the SFTP server.

== `path`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `cluster-backup`

The path on the SFTP server where the backups should be stored.
Relative paths are interpreted relative to the SSH user's home directory on the server.

== `extra_ssh_config`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `''`

Any additional contents for the backup job's `~/.ssh/config` file.
The value must be a valid snippet of SSH config.

The contents are appended to a file which contains a basic config that's constructed from parameters `sftp.host`, `sftp.port` and `sftp.user`.

.Default `~/.ssh/config`
[source]
----
Host <sftp.host>
Port <sftp.port>
User <sftp.user>
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssh_key

----

The SSH config file is mounted to the backup job pod via K8up's `PodConfig` mechanism as `/home/k8up/.ssh`.
Additionally, the `PodConfig` sets environment variable `HOME` to `/home/k8up`.

=== `ssh_private_key`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `'?{vaultkv:${cluster:tenant}/${cluster:name}/cluster-backup/ssh_private_key}'`

The private key to use to authenticate on the SFTP server.
To ensure that the SSH key will be handled correctly, the component will always append a trailing new line to the provided value.

=== `ssh_public_key`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `'?{vaultkv:${cluster:tenant}/${cluster:name}/cluster-backup/ssh_public_key}'`

The public key associated with the private key provided in `ssh_private_key`.
Currently not used, but deployed into the cluster for completeness.

=== `ssh_known_hosts`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `''`

The provided value is used verbatim as the contents for the backup job's `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

== `images`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary

Dictionary holding the container image versions used by this component.

=== `object_dumper`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary
default::
+
[source,yaml]
----
image: docker.io/projectsyn/k8s-object-dumper
tag: latest
----

Object dumper is script that exports all retrievable objects from a Kubernetes API and dumps them as a Tar archive.
See https://github.com/projectsyn/k8s-object-dumper.

=== `etcd_backup`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary
default::
+
[source,yaml]
----
registry: docker.io
image: debian
tag: bullseye
----

The image used to backup etcd.
Required binaries in the image are `chroot` and `tar`.

=== `keepjobs`

[horizontal]
type:: number
default:: `5`

Number of backup jobs to keep.

== `password`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `'?{vaultkv:${cluster:tenant}/${cluster:name}/cluster-backup/password}'`

Password used to encrypt the backup.
The default is a reference to a secret within Vault.


== `ignored`

[horizontal]
type:: list
default::
+
[source,yaml]
----
ignored:
  # OpenShift fucked up and shows the list api as enabled in the API-Discovery
  - projectrequests.project.openshift.io
----

Resource types which will not be backed up.

[NOTE]
====
It is usually no longer necessary to ignore resources with no `list` verb.
The discovery automatically filters them out.
====


== `must_exist`

[horizontal]
type:: list
default:: `[]`

Resource types which must exist on any Kubernetes cluster.
Used to sanity-check the backup process.

They must be fully qualified resource types `<resource>.<group>`, e.g. `deployments.apps`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/releases/tag/v2.11.1[k8up v2.11.1] the errors from backup commands are ignored (https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/issues/910[issue]).

This means that if a resource type listed in `must_exist` is not found, the backup will be created but it will be empty.
For this reason, and because we trust the discovery process of the new dumper, we set the default value to an empty list and recommend to not use this feature until the issue is resolved.
====

== customCA

[horizontal]
type:: dict
default:: `null`

Configure a custom CA for connecting to the backend.

== Example

      object_dumper:
